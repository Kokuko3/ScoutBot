Setup PiCamera on rpi

Setup bt connection on rpi

Test motor control with xbox controller first

Bluetooth interaction with adafruit library?

If it works for xbox controller, just create android app that mirrors inputs to rpi

peer to peer streaming for video (On android possible? Maybe configure to test on PC first)
